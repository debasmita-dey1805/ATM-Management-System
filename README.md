# ATM Management System

A simple console-based ATM simulator in Python that allows users to deposit, withdraw, transfer money, check balance, and change PIN.  
This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and simulates ATM functionalities without a database.

## Features

- User authentication by card number and PIN  
- Deposit and withdrawal of funds  
- Balance inquiry  
- PIN change with validation  
- Money transfer between card holders  

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the `main.py` file using Python 3  
3. Follow on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM system

## Note

Currently, the system does **not** use any database, so data will **not** persist across sessions.  
Database integration and data persistence will be added in future updates.
